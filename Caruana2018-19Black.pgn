{This was the climax of three weeks of chess, months of preparation and
thirteen hard fought previous games. My tournament had its ups and downs, but
thanks to a fortunate win the previous day, I entered the final round half a
point ahead of my closest rivals, Mamedyarov and Karjakin. My tiebreaks were
worse than both of theirs, so I wasn't sure a draw would be enough to win the
event, but at the same time I didn't want to burn my bridges playing for a win.
I also felt that Alexander would be eager for a fight.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3.
d4 {Although this move isn't a usual part of Grischuk's opening repertoire, I
wasn't entirely surprised. I realized that this variation, which leads to an
unclear, playable and fluid game, might suit his style, so I was at least
mentally prepared for this possibility.} Nxe4 4. dxe5 d5 5. Nbd2 Nxd2 ({
Interestingly, I was faced with this variation just two weeks later against
Vitiugov. In that game I chose to play a new move:} 5... Qd7 $5 {, and in the
end I won that game.}) 6. Bxd2 Be7 7. Bd3 {I was already not so familiar with
this position, but my moves seemed easy to play, so I continued to play
naturally.} ({All I could recall was seeing a game by Nepomniatchti recently,
where he played a slightly more passive continuation:} 7. Be2) 7... c5 8. c3
Nc6 9. O-O Bg4 {This was already a big choice. It is very attractive to pin
the knight, but I had to make sure I wouldn't run into a powerful e6 after my
bishop retreats to h5.} (9... Be6 {was perhaps more circumspect, although then
White can consider mixing it up with} 10. b4 $5) 10. Re1 Qd7 (10... O-O {
would be less accurate. For example, White could consider posting a bishop on
f5, which would be very annoying:} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bf5 $5) 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bf4 {
This came as a surprise, but it's probably an excellent move.} ({Now I'm well
prepared for} 12. e6 $2 fxe6) (12. Qc2 Bxf3 13. Bf5 Qc7 14. gxf3 Nxe5 {also
doesn't work out well for White.}) (12. b4 $5 {was the move I was mainly
concerned with. The variations become very complex, but I felt that my
position would be okay after} cxb4 13. cxb4 O-O 14. Qb1 (14. Qc2 $2 Bxf3 15.

Bxg6 hxg6 17. b5 Nd8 18. Ne5 Qe8 19. Qc2 {is an unusual and slightly
concerning pawn sacrifice. Here I was mainly looking at moves like 19...Bh4,
but strongest is} Bd6 $1 20. Nxg6 Rf6 {with an excellent position}) 14... Bxf3
15. Bxh7+ Kh8 16. Bf5 Qc7 17. gxf3 g6 $1 {A very important move.} (17... Nxe5
$2 18. Qd1 $1 {is surprisingly already busted for Black}) 18. Bc2 Nxe5 {
, and the position is unclear, but no worse for Black.}) 12... Qe6 $1 {This
move looks strange, but I came to it by the process of elimination. I need to
prevent e6 once and for all, and although the queen is not a good blockader,
there was no alternative.} ({My first instinct was to play} 12... Nd8 $2 {
, but then I noticed a strong response:} 13. g4 Bg6 (13... Ne6 14. gxh5 Nxf4
15. e6 $1 Nxe6 16. Ne5 {is likewise very strong}) 14. e6 $1 Nxe6 15. Ne5 {
, with a huge attack.}) (12... O-O 13. Qc2 Bg6 (13... Bxf3 14. Bxh7+ Kh8 15.
Bf5 $1 Be4 16. Qxe4 {also doesn't work out for Black.}) 14. Bxg6 hxg6 15. Rad1
{felt like strong pressure for White, because d5 is a weakness and the
possibility of e6 is always in the air.}) 13. a3 $6 {Far too slow. It was here
that Grischuk started to drift with his play.} (13. Qc2 $2 Bxf3 14. Bf5 $2 Be4
{is an important trick, winning a piece.}) (13. Be2 {was the most challenging
move. Here I saw two options:} O-O $5 {offers an exchange sacrifice, but White
is not obligated to accept it.} (13... Bg6 {is playable, but White can perhaps
hope for a slight edge after} 14. Bg3 O-O 15. Nh4 {getting the advantage of
the bishop pair.}) 14. Nd4 (14. Qd2 {prepares Nd4, and would lead to a very
messy situation after} Rfe8 15. Nd4 cxd4 16. Bxh5 dxc3 17. bxc3 d4) 14... Bxe2
15. Nxe6 Bxd1 16. Nxf8 Ba4 (16... Bc2 17. Nd7 Nd8 18. e6 Nxe6 19. Bd2 Rd8 {
also offers decent compensation.}) 17. b3 (17. Nd7 $2 Nd8 {traps the knight})
17... Bb5 18. a4 Bd3 19. Nd7 Rd8 20. e6 fxe6 21. Ne5 Nxe5 22. Bxe5 Bc2 {
This position is likely to end in a draw.}) 13... O-O 14. b4 h6 {Covering g5,
which will be useful in many lines in the future. Also making sure h7 no
longer ever hangs.} ({I couldn't decide on whether to play h6 or} 14... b6 {
, and probably both are fully playable.}) 15. Bg3 {White has many options, but
in every case Black is comfortable.} (15. bxc5 Bxc5 16. Be2 Rad8 17. Nd4 Bxd4
18. cxd4 Bxe2 19. Rxe2 Rc8 {is at least equal, but I would even prefer Black's
position slightly.}) 15... b6 16. Nd4 $6 {I felt during the game that this was
a positional mistake, leading to a comfortable situation for Black.} ({A
better move was} 16. Be2 Bg6 17. Nh4 Bxh4 18. Bxh4 d4 {, with a complex and
roughly balanced position.}) 16... Bxd1 17. Nxe6 fxe6 18. Raxd1 c4 {It's
important to play this before White goes for c4 himself. Now the pawn
structure is very favorable for me: all of White's queenside pawns on the dark
squares are vulnerable, and his bishop on g3 is extremely passive. The only
plus for him is that whenever I open up the position, his light-squared bishop
will become powerful.} 19. Bc2 (19. Bg6 b5 20. f4 Bd8 $1 {and next ...Ne7
kicks the bishop from g6.}) (19. Be2 a5 {is likewise unpleasant for White, and}
20. Bg4 Nd8 {is only temporarily inconvenient. Soon I'll play ...g6 and ...h5.}
) 19... b5 {Preparing ...a5 without allowing b5.} 20. a4 (20. f4 $6 a5 {
would soon become critical for White, because ...axb4 and ...d4 would
completely undermine his queenside.}) 20... a6 21. f3 $1 {A strong and
necessary defense.} (21. f4 {, preparing f5, is most natural, but after} Rac8
$1 {Black prepares ...d4 and White will fall apart. For example} (21... d4 $2
22. Be4 {is clearly wrong.}) 22. axb5 axb5 23. f5 d4 $1 24. cxd4 Nxb4 {, with
a winning position.}) 21... Bg5 $6 {Too academic. I needed to be more daring
to keep the advantage.} ({Now} 21... Rac8 22. Bf2 {leads nowhere.}) (21... Nxb4
$1 {was the most testing move:} 22. cxb4 Bxb4 23. Re2 Be7 24. axb5 axb5 25. Rb1
b4 {, and White will have to defend accurately against the three passed pawns.
I didn't really consider sacrificing, however, because the game continuation
looked so attractive.}) 22. Bf2 $2 {This mistake is very serious, and seems to
be the difference between a draw and a loss.} (22. h4 $1 Bf4 23. Bxf4 Rxf4 {
I understand why Grischuk didn't want to give away his bishop pair, but White
is already close to equal after} 24. Bg6 {For example,} Rc8 (24... Ne7 25. h5)
25. Kf2 d4 26. axb5 axb5 27. cxd4 Nxb4 28. Rb1 Nd5 29. Rxb5 Rxd4 30. Reb1 {
, with a likely draw.}) 22... Bf4 23. Bc5 Rfd8 24. Bd6 Bg3 25. Re2 g5 {When I
played 21...Bg5 I saw this position, and I was very happy to get it. White is
almost completely paralyzed, due to the dominant bishop on g3. However, it is
still difficult to make progress.} 26. Kf1 Kf7 27. Bc7 Re8 28. Bd6 Rac8 {
A strange move. We were both low on time, so I was a bit unsure of what to do,
but placing a rook on c8 is certainly not the way.} ({I should have started by
placing my pawn on h4, which is useful in many variations down the road. Most
concretely, often White will play Rxd5 and e6, and with the pawn on h4 the
bishop will be defended.} 28... h5 $1 29. Ra1 h4 30. Bb1 Red8 {, and sooner or
later White will slowly die.}) 29. Ra1 Red8 30. Bb1 {As usual, when time gets
low, Grischuk continues to play very well.} Rd7 ({I could still place my pawn
on h4 before deciding what to do next:} 30... h5 31. axb5 axb5 32. Ra6 h4 {
and here} 33. Rb6 Rd7 34. Rxb5 Ra8 {is not something I should worry about.})
31. Ra3 (31. axb5 axb5 32. Ra6 {was a better defense. I was planning} Ra7 {
, but after} ({Perhaps} 32... h5 $5 {is again the best move.}) 33. Rxa7+ Nxa7
34. Ra2 Nc6 35. Ra6 {White's position becomes a bit easier to hold.}) 31... d4
{I was extremely happy to get this move in at an opportune moment. We were
both short on time, but now the play becomes forced:} 32. axb5 axb5 33. cxd4
Nxd4 34. Rea2 Nc6 35. Be4 Bxe5 36. Bxc6 (36. Bc5 Kf6 {is also very bad for
White.}) 36... Rxd6 37. Bxb5 {Black has a serious advantage, due to the
strength of the passed c-pawn and the weakness of White's king. The weakened
dark squares around White's kingside make a direct attack very likely in the
future. The next few moves were played in heavy time trouble, which led to
some poor decisions.} Rd1+ (37... c3 $1 {was strongest:} 38. Ba4 (38. Rc2 Rb8
39. Ra5 Kf6 {leaves White tied up, and likely to lose the b-pawn.}) 38... Rcd8
39. b5 Rd3 {and White is paralyzed and facing ideas of ...Bd6.}) 38. Ke2 Rg1
39. Ke3 Rb1 $2 ({Direct play was again best:} 39... c3 $1 40. Rc2 Rd8 {with a
decisive edge. For example} 41. Ra7+ Kf6 42. Rd7 Rb8 43. Bd3 Rxb4 {with a
position similar to the game.}) 40. Ra7+ $2 {The last move of the time control,
and it is both an extremely natural and a poor one.} (40. Ra8 $1 Rxa8 41. Rxa8
Rxb4 42. Ba4 {This is difficult to decide on, since White condemns himself to
a pawn down position where he will suffer for a very long time. However,
trading rooks is absolutely necessary to keep any drawing chances alive.})
40... Kf6 {And now I could finally get up from the table and check the other
games. I was pleased to see Karjakin had already drawn, and Kramnik and
Mamedyarov were playing a drawn ending. I felt very safe that a draw would be
enough for tournament victory, but of course with a much better position, I
continued to play.} 41. Bd7 Bf4+ 42. Ke2 (42. Kf2 Rd8 {is essentially the same
as the game.} (42... c3 $2 {looks very beautiful, but misses the win after} 43.

runs into an exchange sac:} Rb2+ 44. Kf1 Rxd7 $1 45. Rxd7 c3 46. Rc6 c2 {
and the pawn is unstoppable. Black will be a piece ahead.}) 43... Rxb4 (43...

saw no reason to just take the pawn and win slowly.}) 44. Bc6 c3 {A pawn up,
and still with a positional advantage. I knew I was completely winning, and
around this point I saw Kramnik and Mamedyarov agree to a draw. A draw would
have been enough for me, but I couldn't bring myself to offer it in such an
overwhelming position.} 45. Rd7 Rc8 {Of course, no trade of rooks.} 46. Be4 h5

is that the day after tomorrow we will have quite a tense game in the 'Spanish
torture', unless the challenger changes his first move. Of course, it's just a
shot in the dark, but sometimes you are happy when you guess the right opening.

It is the first WC that I am following, without any strong 'feelings' in the
opening phase! Well, this is a well-known pawn structure, mainly coming from
the ‘Exchange Variation’ of the ‘French Defence’ (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.
exd5 exd5). There is a clear drawn tendency, mainly because there are not many
good pawn breaks and as some pieces can rapidly be exchanged, there is not
much play left. But of course we must keep I mind that an equal position is
not necessary a drawn one; mistakes need to be made and explored in order to
have a decisive result. And this can happen in any position…} 15. Bd3 d5 16.

{While the Women’s World Championship Cycle is going to imitate the overall
World Championship, it might also hold the other way around. After eight
rounds, there remained four games and an eventual tie-break to be played to
determine the winner. The finale of the Women’s World Championship looks
quite similar in this respect, doesn’t it? The match has been quite tense,
both players have been fighting hard and it is therefore surprising that all
the games finished in draws. This shows high class of both players as well as
their superb defensive abilities. Moreover, the permanent progress of the
opening theory makes it increasingly difficult to achieve an advantage with
White against a well-prepared opponent. We all have probably hoped to see more
decisive games, but it is really very hard to beat a 2800-rated player.} 1. c4

{This game was played in the 8th round. I had a slow start to the event and
was trailing Magnus coming into this game, so I felt I needed a win to try to
keep pace and some hope to catch him in first place. I also had the feeling
that Georg would not shy away from a fight. Diese Partie wurde in der 8. Runde
gespielt. Ich war langsam ins Turnier gestartet und hatte Rückstand auf
Magnus, deshalb brauchte ich gefühlt einen Sieg, um Schritt halten zu können
und gewisse Hoffnung zu wahren, ihn auf dem ersten Platz noch einzuholen.
Außerdem hatte ich das Gefühl, dass Georg vor einem Kampf nicht
zurückscheuen würde.} 1. e4 $5 {And this confirmed my feeling. I decided
that the best way to play for a win was to go straight for a fight with the
Sicilian. Und dies bestätigte mein Gefühl. Ich entschied, der beste Weg, auf
Gewinn zu spielen, wäre, geradewegs einen Kampf mit dem Sizilianer
anzustreben..} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {A position that certainly has become
familiar to me over the last year! Eine Stellung, die mir im Lauf des letzten
Jahres durchaus vertraut geworden ist!} g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7.
Nc3 Nd7 8. Be3 e5 9. Qd2 h6 10. a3 {It is important to know the main ideas for
both sides. The break f4 is natural, but a3-b4 can also be quite annoying for
Black if executed without a challenge. Es ist wichtig, die beiderseitigen
Hauptideen zu kennen. Der Hebel f4 ist natürlich, aber auch a3-b4 kann
ziemlich lästig für Schwarz sein, wenn man ungehindert dazu kommt.} b6 11. b4
{[#] We are already in new territory. If Black is forced to take on b4 he will
be under permanent pressure down the a-file and will have trouble dealing with
a potential b5, weakening the d5 square. I was in no mood to play a passive
position. Wir befinden uns bereits auf neuem Terrain. Falls Schwarz gezwungen
ist, auf b4 zu nehmen, wird er in der a-Linie unter permanentem Druck stehen
und es schwer haben, einem potentiellen b5 zu begegnen, was das Feld d5
schwächt. Ich hatte keine Lust, eine passive Stellung zu spielen.} Nf8 $5 12.
bxc5 Ne6 13. cxb6 axb6 {Black sacrifices a pawn for a couple of tempi, and
though it might seem far from clear on what he has achieved, this become
readily apparent when some moves are played on the board. Schwarz opfert einen
Bauern für ein paar Tempi, und obwohl bei weitem nicht auf der Hand liegen
mag, was er erreicht hat, wird es, nachdem ein paar Züge auf dem Brett
gespielt sind, sonnenklar.} 14. Qc1 (14. O-O f5 $40) 14... f5 15. a4 f4 {
My longest think of the game, and a point where again I had tempting options.
I also wanted to make sure that my plan of crashing through the kingside made
sense when his king is still on e1! Meine längste Denkphase der Partie, und
ein Punkt, an dem ich erneut verlockende Optionen hatte. Außerdem wolle ich
sichergehen, dass mein Plan, am Köngisflügel durchzubrechen, auch sinnvoll
ist, wenn sein König noch auf e1 steht!} 16. Bd2 O-O {Both sides have
clarified their plans. White wants to consolidate and use the extra pawn to
full effect, trying to put his pieces in a way that they stymie Black's attack.
Beide Seiten haben ihre Pläne definiert. Weiß will sich konsolidieren und
den Mehrbauern voll zur Geltung bringen, wobei er versucht, seine Figuren so
anzuordnen, dass sie den Angriff von Schwarz ersticken.} 17. Qb2 Nd4 $1 18. Ne2
(18. Nxd4 exd4 19. Ne2 f3 20. gxf3 Rxf3 {and Black's rook on f3 is just
monstrous. und der schwarze Turm auf f3 ist einfach monströs.}) 18... Nxf3+
19. gxf3 Be6 20. Rb1 {Georg must have felt that his position was already quite
uncomfortable, taking a considerable amount of time on this move. Georg hat
wohl gespürt, dass seine Stellung bereits recht unangenehm war, denn er
verbrauchte für diesen Zug beträchtlich viel Zeit.} Ra6 21. Bc3 Qc7 22. Rg1
Kh7 23. h4 Rb8 24. Ra1 (24. d4 Rxa4 25. dxe5 Ra2 26. Qc1 Bc4 $5 $13) 24... c5
25. Kd2 Rd8 $6 {[#] I was happy with my position here, but the computers point
out that this was actually a bad mistake! [#] Hier war ich glücklich mit
meiner Stellung, aber die Computer zeigen, dass dies in Wirklichkeit ein
böser Fehler war!} 26. Rgd1 (26. Rxg6 $3 {did not really cross our minds
during the game. kam uns während der Partie nicht wirklich in den Sinn.} Kxg6
27. Nxf4+ Kf7 {Black is up a rook, but the engines claim that after Schwarz
hat einen Turm mehr, aber die Engines behaupten, dass nach} (27... exf4 28.
Rg1+ {just wins gewinnt einfach.}) 28. Rg1 Bf6 29. Nxe6 Kxe6 30. f4 {it is now
White that has a powerful attack. It was certainly difficult to evaluate such
a position, especially in my opponent's looming time pressure. nunmehr Weiß
derjenige ist, der kraftvollen Angriff hat. Eine solche Stellung
einzuschätzen, war natürlich schwierig, zumal in der sich anbahnenden
Zeitnot meines Gegners.}) 26... Bh3 27. Qb5 Rda8 28. Rg1 Qd6 29. Qb2 R8a7 $1 {
A move that highlights how difficult White's position is. It parries White's
only threat of Nxf4, and Black is currently keeping all the pluses in the
position. Ein Zug, der betont, wie schwierig die Stellung von Weiß ist. Er
pariert die einzige weiße Drohung Sxf4, und Schwarz hält aktuell alle
Trümpfe in der Stellung.} 30. Rab1 Qf6 31. a5 {The queenside finally opens up,
but Black is better prepared for this. Endlich öffnet sich der Damenflügel,
aber Schwarz ist dafür besser vorbereitet.} Bd7 32. axb6 Rb7 33. h5 g5 34. Ra1
{The next few moves were played trying to get to the 40 move mark, and it is
not difficult for me to keep control of the position with my pair of bishops
and the difficult situation of White's king on d2. Die nächsten paar Züge
wurden gespielt, um die 40. Züge-Marke zu schaffen, und es ist für mich, mit
meinem Läuferpaar und der misslichen Situation des weißen Königs auf d2,
nicht schwer, die Stellung zu kontrollieren.} Raxb6 35. Qa3 Qd6 36. Nc1 Be6 37.
Rh1 Bf7 38. Ke2 Qd7 39. Qa4 Rc6 40. Qa5 c4 {With time pressure over, it is
clear that White cannot parry all of my threats. Doubling on the c-file and
crashing through is the most pressing one, but as we will soon see others will
also arise. Bei geschaffter Zeitnot ist klar, dass Weiß nicht all meine
Drohungen parieren kann. Verdoppeln und Durchbrechen in der c-Linie ist am
zwingendsten, aber wie wir gleich sehen, werden sich auch noch andere ergeben.}
41. Ra3 Rbc7 42. Kd2 Rc5 43. Qa8 Rc8 44. Ra7 {Desperate, but White's position
was beyond salvation. Verzweiflung, aber die weiße Stellung war jenseits von
Gut und Böse.} (44. Qa4 Qxa4 45. Rxa4 cxd3 46. Ra3 dxc2 {looks simply lost
sieht einfach verloren aus.}) 44... Qb5 45. Qxc8 (45. Qb7 Qxb7 46. Rxb7 cxd3 {
is even worse than in the previous variation. ist sogar noch schlimmer als in
der vorigen Variante.}) 45... Rxc8 46. Rxf7 {A knight, a pawn and a rook might
sometimes be able to fight against a queen, but here I'm just scooping up all
the pawns and the attack continues. On top of that, the rook on f7 is trapped!
The rest is easy. Ein Springer, ein Bauer und ein Turm können manchmal gegen
eine Dame kämpfen, aber hier sammle ich einfach alle Bauern ein, und der
Angriff geht weiter. Obendrein ist auch noch der Turm f7 gefangen! Der Rest
ist leicht.} Kg8 47. Rxg7+ Kxg7 48. d4 exd4 49. Bxd4+ Kf7 50. Rd1 c3+ 51. Ke1
Qb2 {Despite the mistakes, this was a massively complicated and interesting
fight. Unfortunately, because Magnus started to run away with the tournament
near the end, it was only enough for second place. Trotz der Fehler war dies
ein immens komplizierter und interessanter Kampf. Leider reicht es, da Magnus
zum Turnierende auszureißen begann, nur zum zweiten Platz.} 0-1

anyway.} (9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. dxe5 Bc5 11. O-O Ba6 12. Re1 Qxd1 13. Rxd1 Rfd8 {

promising:} 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Ba3 c5 (13... Re8 14. Nf3 $1 Bxc3 15. Rc1 Bf6 16.

development and also his dark-squared bishop is a nuisance.}) 14... Rad8 $13)

some cool moves like this one pretending that nothing is wrong but a human
would (quite rightfully) prefer to resolve the tension in the centre.}) 15.
Bxf3 {White now has the bishop pair but it is not that simple to make progress
as the position is not easy to open.} b6 {Black could postpone this move and
play for example the more natural Qe7 first but a transposition was very
likely to happen anyway.} (15... Qe7 {was more natural.}) 16. Qe2 {White
continues with the development} (16. g3 g5 17. Bg4 Qe7 18. Qe2 Kh8 {is very
much recommended by the engine but it's not that clear what was White's big
achievement.}) 16... Qe7 17. Rd1 Rad8 18. Bd2 {Both sides finished developing
and we got to a rather complex position where White's play feels nevertheless
easier.} g6 $1 {Quite logical to take back some control on the light squares.}
19. Be1 Kg7 20. Rac1 h5 {To have some attacking chances on the kingside Black
would need to get g4 into play but it's not likely to happen anytime soon.
However, White's Bf3 is quite stuck on this prophilactic role reducing White's
chances for an advantage to a minimum.} 21. h3 c5 22. Kf1 Nc6 {Playing for a
blockade.} (22... c4 $5 {Similar to some Grunfeld positions, c4 was entirely
playable. Black gets some queenside play and also has the c5 square for the
knight in case White plays either dxe5 or d5.}) 23. Qb5 (23. d5 {Even though
the engine strongly advocates this move, it will be almost impossible to break
through.} Na5 (23... Nb8) 24. c4 Bc7 (24... Nb7 25. a4) 25. Rb1 Rb8 26. Qc2 (

fortress. However, probably it was preferable to the game as at least here
White can try something.}) 23... Rc8 24. dxc5 {Opens the position but now the
black B will find a really comfortable place on c5.} (24. d5 Nb8 25. a4 (25. c4

{I had a strong feeling before this game that we were in for a big fight. I
didn't feel like checking Maxime's prep in the Petroff or Sveshnikov (which he
had recently faced against Magnus), so I went for something offbeat.} 1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Bc5 {This accelerated Arkhangelsk isn't
entirely unusual, but it has fallen out of fashion the last few years. However,
Maxime had faced it recently against Vishy, so I was sure he wouldn't be
unprepared. The point of this move order is both to avoid Nxe5 variations and,
in case of the game, to give Black extra options with ...Bb7 or ...Bg4.} 6. c3
b5 7. Bb3 (7. Bc2 d5 {is another main line, with a huge body of theory.}) 7...
d6 8. a4 Bb7 9. d3 ({In my opinion,} 9. d4 Bb6 {is a more dangerous system for
Black. The move Maxime played is more positional and less theoretical.}) 9...
h6 {Not a move I want to play, but necessary to avoid Bg5.} ({It's important
to avoid} 9... O-O 10. Bg5 $1 h6 11. Bh4 {because the pin is extremely
difficult to break.} g5 12. Nxg5 $1 hxg5 13. Bxg5 {is already close to winning
for White.}) 10. axb5 ({When Maxime faced the same variation against Anand a
few weeks prior, he chose to play} 10. Re1 O-O 11. axb5 axb5 12. Rxa8 {and here
} Qxa8 {would've been completely fine for Black.}) (10. Nh4 {is a very
dangerous option. The threat of Nf5 can't be ignored, but luckily Black has a
way to defend using tactics:} Bc8 $1 {and} 11. axb5 {can be met by} Bg4 $1 12.
Qe1 axb5) 10... axb5 11. Rxa8 {Here I was already on my own, and the choice
between capturing with queen or bishop was very difficult.} Qxa8 (11... Bxa8 {
is probably also playable.} 12. Nh4 $5 {worried me, but it seems that after}
Nxe4 {Black survives by a miracle:} 13. Qh5 (13. Nf5 Nxf2 {is a huge mess.})
13... Ng5 $1 14. Bxg5 (14. d4 exd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxf7+ Kd7 $1) 14... Qxg5
15. Qxf7+ Kd8 {, and the king runs.}) 12. Nh4 {This is the move I had expected,
but if Maxime wanted to go for Na3 ideas, perhaps it was best to play it
immediately.} (12. Na3 b4 13. Nc4 bxc3 14. bxc3 O-O {is close to equal anyway.}
) 12... Bc8 $1 {Necessary, to prevent Nf5.} (12... Ne7 {is more natural, and
was my first instinct, but after} 13. Kh1 $1 {I saw no comfortable way to deal
with f4.} d5 {only makes} 14. f4 $1 {even stronger.}) 13. Na3 $6 {This is
inconsistent. It's rarely a good idea to start a plan on one side of the board
and then an entirely different plan on the other side.} (13. Kh1 {was what I
had expected. Now} Qa1 $1 ({I had instead intended} 13... g5 $5 14. Qf3 Ke7 15.
Nf5+ Bxf5 16. Qxf5 Qc8 $1 17. Qf3 Qg4 {with an equal ending. White has the two
bishops but Black has a space advantage as compensation.}) 14. Nd2 O-O {
is very strong, because the knight on d2 blocked off White from playing f4 and
capturing with the bishop. This wasn't clear to me over the board though.}) (
13. Qf3 Ne7 {again prevents Nf5, when White's next move is unclear.}) 13... Bg4
{This is useful to misplace White's queen. It might look visually better
placed on c2, but it really belongs on d1 so it can swing to f3 at the right
moment.} 14. Qc2 Qb8 (14... Qb7 $5 {was maybe a better choice. I wanted to
keep the option of ...Qd8 to protect my kingside, but in most variations that
doesn't seem necessary.}) 15. Kh1 {Now White threatens f4, which would be
positionally advantageous for him, so I felt compelled to prevent it.} g5 {
Of course this is a weakening of my position, but the transition that follows
also wrecks White's pawns, and leads to a very double edged position.} 16. Nf5
(16. h3 Bd7 17. Nf3 {is the machine's choice, but I barely considered it. It
seemed to me that} g4 18. hxg4 Nxg4 {would give Black a serious initiative.})
16... Bxf5 17. exf5 O-O {I was happy with this move, but perhaps it wasn't
best.} (17... Kf8 $5 {will put the king on the same square, but the rook might
end up being better placed on h8 than f8. This is just a minor detail though.})
18. Qd1 {Now it becomes clear that the queen was misplaced on c2. Now White is
preparing Nc2, to get the misplaced knight back in the game.} (18. h4 {looks
like it starts an attack, but after} Kg7 $1 {, the rook will come to h8 and if
the h-file opens, the hunter will become the hunted.}) 18... Na5 $5 {This was
another tough decision, because I had to try to evaluate the unbalanced
position which arose in the game.} ({The lazy part of me wanted to just play
the useful} 18... Kg7 {, but I didn't want to allow the knight to get back in
the game with} 19. Nc2 {As it turns out, Black is much better after} b4 $1 20.
Ne3 bxc3 21. bxc3 Bxe3 $1 22. Bxe3 Ne7 {, but this wasn't as clear to me as it
should have been. I guess I should trust lazy me more often!}) 19. Bxf7+ {
The natural choice, but objectively it isn't clear whether this or Ba2 was
better.} ({My idea was} 19. Ba2 b4 $1 20. Nc4 (20. cxb4 Qxb4 {The ruining of
White's structure would've made me very happy.}) 20... b3 21. Bb1 Nxc4 22. dxc4
e4 23. f4 g4 {but surprisingly after} (23... exf3 24. Qxf3 Qd8 {, with a solid
positional advantage, is best.}) 24. Bd2 {White gets Be1-h4 in time and might
hold equality.}) 19... Rxf7 20. b4 Bxb4 21. cxb4 Nc6 22. Nc2 {The dust has
settled. On the one hand, Black's kingside structure has been somewhat damaged;
on the other hand, Black has a positional advantage on the queenside and
center. For the moment, f5 is a bit vulnerable, so I went about exploiting
that.} Qc8 $1 23. g4 {White is forced to weaken his king's position as well.} (
23. Qf3 Ne7 {is extremely awkward for White to deal with.}) 23... Qa8 {And now
I take control over the long diagonal.} 24. f3 (24. Qf3 $2 {allows} Nxg4 $1 25.
Qxg4 Nxb4+ 26. f3 Nxc2 {with a two pawn advantage.}) 24... Qa2 {This invasion
was the point of the entire maneuver. The queen on a2 is extremely annoying
for White to deal with. It also often aids in a direct attack, if and when the
h-file opens.} 25. d4 $6 {This is a mistake, but also an understandable move.
Maxime wanted to get the d3 square to liberate his queen a bit.} (25. h4 Nd5 {
looked very promising to me during the game, but after the prophylactic} 26.
Kg1 $1 {getting out of the way of checks when the h-file opens, the position
is just unclear. For example,} Nf4 27. Bxf4 exf4 28. Qd2) 25... Re7 $6 {
And I responded with a mistake in return. This move felt right, but after I
played it I started regretting the move.} (25... e4 26. f4 {looked like a mess
to me, but after the accurate} Rg7 $1 {holding the g5 stronghold, Black has an
advantage. White's king is weaker than Black's.}) 26. dxe5 dxe5 {This wasn't
the plan.} (26... Rxe5 {was my first intention. It seemed like I would quickly
create strong threats with ...Nd5 or ...Rd5, but then it dawned on me that
after} 27. h4 $1 {, my threats are entirely illusory and White is creating
quick counterplay on the kingside.}) (26... Nxe5 27. Nd4 {, with the knight
invading on e6, didn't appeal to me at all.}) 27. Qd3 $2 {A really bad move
for more than one reason, but surprisingly it wasn't immediately clear to me
how bad it was.} (27. h4 $1 {worried me, because I didn't see clear play for
me while White is breaking down my kingisde structure. The game would be
finely balanced after say} Rd7 28. Qe2 Nd5 29. hxg5 Ndxb4 30. gxh6 Qxc2 31. Qe3
{, and the game will likely end in a perpetual.}) 27... e4 {A fine move, but
there was another good option as well.} ({Very strong was the cool} 27... Rd7
28. Qc3 Rd6 $1 {I don't think either of us understood how poorly placed the
queen is on c3. White is in serious trouble.}) 28. Qc3 (28. fxe4 $2 Ne5 {
picks up g4 and then e4, with a decisive advantage.}) 28... Ne5 {This is the
point. White's structure is collapsing, so Maxime needed create some chaos.}
29. f4 (29. fxe4 $2 Nexg4 {is just resigns.}) 29... Nd5 30. Qh3 $2 {This move
surprised me, but again it provoked a serious mistake in return.} (30. Qc5 {
was what I expected.} gxf4 31. f6 $1 {seemed very tricky to me, but after} (31.
Bxf4 $2 Nd3 {wins a piece.}) 31... Rf7 32. Qxb5 {, Black has a decisive
advantage with} Nd7 $1) (30. Qd4 $1 {was the best chance. The point is} Nf3 31.
Qc5 $1 {, and now Black doesn't have the ...Nd3 option after gxf4 Bxf4.
Provoking the knight to f3 is a very unusual idea and neither of us considered
it. However, Black is still borderline winning after} Qc4 $1 32. Qxc4 bxc4 33.
fxg5 hxg5) 30... Nf3 $2 {When I saw this move, it felt like it was crying out
to be played. My intuition let me down. The next few moves are all mistakes,
which is either a sign that the position is far too complex or that we were
not playing our best that day.} (30... e3 $1 {is winning, but it requires
accurate calculation:} 31. fxe5 (31. Nxe3 Nxf4 32. Qxh6 Qa8+ $1 {is a cute
geometric pattern:} 33. Kg1 Ne2+ 34. Kf2 Nxc1 35. Qxg5+ Rg7 {, and the checks 
(and the game) are over.}) 31... e2 32. Re1 Qxc2 {, and if e5 falls the
e2-pawn will be a decisive factor, so White is forced into} 33. e6 {, but after

I barely considered, because it seemed like White had no checks or serious
counterplay. But the game is surprisingly complex anyway, because of White's
powerful pawns.} Ne5 $1 {is necessary, to prepare ...e3 and ...Qe4. Now a long

(32. f6 $3 {was a surprising shot we both missed. I didn't even consider the
move.} Nxf6 33. fxg5 $1 {is the tactical justification.} hxg5 34. Rxe1 e3 35.

chances are very high.}) 32... e3 $1 {This is the winning move. I believe that
what Maxime missed was that Qxh6 won't lead to perpetual check, so he's left
without counterplay and with a dead lost position.} 33. fxg5 (33. Qxh6 Qf2 $1 {

strategic content and the tactical mess at the end.} 0-1
